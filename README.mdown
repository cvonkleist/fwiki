# fwiki: Retarded simple

The fwiki is a one-file Ruby wiki powered by Sinatra, Datamapper, pwnsauce, and RDiscount. I'm going to use it as my GTD wiki.

## Numbers followed by nouns

- 211 lines of code
- 42% test coverage (I made this up; I have no idea)
- 1/2 assed
- 100% reliable 99% of the time

## How to install it

1. Download `fwiki.rb`
2. Edit the configuration section inside `fwiki.rb`
2. `ruby fwiki.rb`

## Requirements

- sinatra
- haml
- datamapper
- rdiscount

## How to start using it

Go to `http://localhost:4567/` to see all the pages you have in your fwiki. Since you don't have any pages yet, there will be nothing there.

### Create your **home** page

Click the **home** link at the top of the page. You will get a 404 page with a form that will let you create it.

### Creating new pages

There are two ways to create a new page:

1. Use your browser to go to a page that doesn't exist, like `http://localhost:4567/asdfasdf`
2. Type a fwikilink in a page that does exist, and click on it (like [[asdfasdf]])

(Okay, #2 is actually just a different way to do #1.)

## Markdown, Textile, etc.

If you want to use something other than Markdown, just change this method in `fwiki.rb`:

    # render page contents as html
    #
    # for something besides markdown, process as you like
    def htmlify(text)
      RDiscount.new(text).to_html
    end

Change it to something like this:

    def htmlify(text)
      RedCloth.new(text).to_html
    end

Also, change `require 'rdiscount'` to `require 'redcloth'` at the top of `fwiki.rb`.
